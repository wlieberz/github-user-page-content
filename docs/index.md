# About this Blog

This blog will probably mostly contain posts about DevOps, 
programming, Linux, neat opensource projects, and suchlike topics. It will 
probably be updated sporadically and infrequently.

## About Me

My name is William Lieberz. I was born and raised in Los Angeles.
I am currently working as a Senior Systems Engineer in the Container Engineering space*.

*Currently, for me, the Container Engineering space consists of: Container registries/repos, writing and maintaining common library Helm charts, etc., as
well as creating automation and tooling around these topics to promote best-practices and add governance guardrails for our dev teams.
